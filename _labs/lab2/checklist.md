1. For any given expected input, how many jumps does the program take when opting
   to use a jump table in `dense_choice_switch`,
   compared with using if-else blocks in `dense_choice_if`?
   How might the program figure out that an unexpected input of `-1` would
   need to be handled as a `default` case?

2. Using the sample Makefile, trace what happens when you issue `make`
   with no arguments: what does it try to build? How does it determine
   what actions to take?

3. There are 7 segments on a 7-segment display
   labeled A, B, C, D, E, F, G.
   What segments would you turn on
   to generate a "0", a "1", an "A"?
