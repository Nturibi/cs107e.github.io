1 Explain what must be true for a division expression in C to compile 
and execute correctly despite the lack of a ARM divide instruction. What
is the result of attempting to compile a true division that cannot be
so transformed? 

2 There are 7-segments on a 7-segment display 
labeled A, B, C, D, E, F, G.
What segments would you turn on
to generate a "0", a "1", an "A"?

3 Using the sample Makefile, trace what happens when you issue "make" 
with no arguments: what does it try to build? how does it determine
what actions to take?
