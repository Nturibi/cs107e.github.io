1. Using the sample Makefile, trace what happens when you issue `make`
   with no arguments: what does it try to build? How does it determine
   what actions to take?

2. If `is_prime()` is implemented and works correctly (i.e. division
   is available and so on), what should you see the Pi doing if you
   `assert(is_prime(10))`? Why?

3. There are 7 segments on a 7-segment display
   labeled A, B, C, D, E, F, G.
   What segments would you turn on
   to generate a "0", a "1", an "A"?
