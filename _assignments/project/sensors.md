The following sensors 
are available for you 
to use in your projects 
in addition to the peripherals 
you have worked with during this quarter.
Let us know if you want to use them!

## Analog

Unfortunately, the Raspberry Pi does not have 
a digital-to-analog convertor (DAC) peripheral.
In order to use these sensors 
requires that you use an DAC chip
such as the MCP3008. 
We have example code showing how to use that chip.
